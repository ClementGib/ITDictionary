- **Chatbot**: chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users 24/7, used to gather data, user support, shopping assistance, financial service and many more.
- **Rule-based Chatbot**: pre-programmed chatbot conversation with ruled answer (if/then), limited input, no intent or synonyms interpretation.
- **AI-Chatbot** : Use NLP, free questions with no rule-based answer, can understand intent of query and synonyms. Collect Data to learn (ML)
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** : It's a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both natural and meaningful
- **Machine learning (ML)** : It is a subset of AI focus on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions
based on data without being explicitly programmed to do so. Use labeled or unlabeled data, can be surpevised or unsupervise. Using many algorithms and models like linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, clustering algorithms.
used in many domain like Natural language processing, Image and speech recognition, Fraud detection, Financial forecasting...
- **Labeled/unlabeled data**:
- **Supervision learning**: Surpevised learning, Unsupervised learning, Semi-supervised, Reinforcement Learning
- **Linear regression**:
- **Decision trees**:
- **Support vector machines**:
- **Neural networks**:
- **Clustering algorithms**:
- **Evaluation and Validation**: Machine learning models need to be evaluated and validated to ensure their performance and generalization ability.
Techniques such as cross-validation, holdout validation, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used for model evaluation.
- **Cross-validation**:
- **Holdout validation**:
- **F1 score**
